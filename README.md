# Phone number parser
### by Anton Pysmennyi

#### This small parser will help you with some basic operations regarding the phone numbers. 
#### This includes:
<ul>
    <li> format conversion (to E.164) </li>
    <li> country codes extraction </li>
    <li> operator extraction </li>
</ul>

#### Here are currently supported phone number formats: 
<ul>
    <li> +380 44 1231231 </li>
    <li> +380 (44) 1231231 </li>
    <li> +380 50 123 4567 </li>
    <li> 00 380 (50) 123 4567 </li>
</ul>

#### This list can be expanded in the future updates
